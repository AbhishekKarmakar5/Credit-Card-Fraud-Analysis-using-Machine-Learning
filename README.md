## Credit Card Fraud Detection.pdf
It's a python implementation based project - 

The following steps has been performed for correct modelling :-
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Modeling

3.1. Logistic Regression 
      -> Training Accuracy : 0.999242223984492
      -> Testing Accuracy : 0.9991188806259472
      
3.2. Random Forest Classifier
      -> Training Accuracy : 1.0
      -> Testing Accuracy : 0.9995241955380115
      
3.3. XGBClassifier
      -> Training Accuracy : 1.0
      -> Testing Accuracy : 0.9995418179254926
      
4. Use of SMOTE Algorithm for data balancing
       -> And then retraining the model to see the difference.
